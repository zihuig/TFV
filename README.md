# TFV
Table-based fact verification is an important method to verify claims which contain professional knowledge. However, existing work focuses on verify one claim with one certain table, which is known as ``table entailment". This is not suitable for the real-world scenario, that is, the user will not input the certain table for each claim. From the perspective of users, we propose TFV, a unified system for table-based fact verification. Before table entailment, this system will automatically filter tables unrelated to the given claim. Then we integrate the table entailment stage into three steps: pre-training,  intermediate pre-training and fine-tuning. For each step, there are multiple models to choose. Through the combination of different models, we analyze the impact of different influencing factors on table entailment. Especially in the second step, we propose structure-aware intermediate pre-training to implement the tabular data understanding.
